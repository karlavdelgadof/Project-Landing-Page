# Project-Landing-Page
This project is a web page (My First Landing Page) created from scratch using and implementing all the knowledge The Odin Project has provided me with at the moment.
I've created the web page using HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. However, I've taken some liberties with the styling part, even though I managed to meet the design structure given in the curriculum.
